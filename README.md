### Product
  My ajax project is a blog where you can read old blog posts and post your own. You can sort by newly added posts or other categories. You can also browse the media library that conatins "recommended" movies and books. 

### Technologies used for this project : 
   - Bootstrap :  Was used to create a responsive menu bar and it was also used to make a clean grid system with rows and columns making the structure slick and organized.
   - Html/CSS : Barely worth mentioning.
   - Jquery : For all four ajax calls, adding all the fetched data to the page. On click functions for anchor tags in the menu. 
   - Ajax calls using Jquery : Four different apis to get content on the page.
   - Javascript : For submitting the user written posts. For filtering to only view new posts as well as for only viewing the movies and books with the highest ratings.
