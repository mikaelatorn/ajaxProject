### Product
  My ajax project is a blog where you can read old blog posts and post your own. You can sort by newly added posts or other categories. You can also browse the media library that conatins "recommended" movies and books. 

### Technologies used for this project : 
   
   - Html/CSS 
   - Bootstrap   
   - Jquery  
   - Ajax 
   - Javascript 
    
### APIs used

  - http://www.filltext.com
  - http://netflixroulette.net/api
  - https://pixabay.com/api
  - https://www.googleapis.com/books
  
  1. Filltext is used to recieve dummy blog posts with random name, date, lorem ipsum as the text and a category.
  2. NetflixRoulette is used to get and list movies in the media tab with description, name, poster and rating.
  3. Pixabay api is used to recieve random pictures that i used as a background for all blog posts old and new.
  4. Google books api for getting books in the media tab with rating, poster and description.
  
 

#### Workflow 

I developed the website mobile first but starting with creating a simple wireframe in illustrator. The order that i like to work when i build a website is beginning with the structure in HTML5 to create the barebones for the website with some very simple design. Then develop the functionality and finally focus on the design to make it look pretty.

#### Conclusion :

What went well : The website is fully responsive, good use of html tags. The design looks good and i found four different apis that i combined into a combined product.


However, what I can improve is that i would like to challenge my skills more and use pure javascript instead of jquery when it's easier. I don't like that the images from Google Books api and Netflix roulette is very low resolution. Next time spend more time finding an api which provides higher resolution pictures. It makes a big difference to the design.
